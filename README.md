Files from 2010 EBL model

This page contains models of the extragalactic background light (EBL). This is the background light from direct stellar radiation and stellar radiation reprocessed by dust, and spans the far-infrared to the ultraviolet. The corresponding publication is

Finke, Razzaque, & Dermer, 2010, ApJ, 712, 238 .

The energy densities for our "model C" are in EBLenergydensity.tar.gz. This model uses a fit to the star formation data in Hopkins & Beacom (2006) using a parameterization from Cole et al. (2001) and a Baldry & Glazebrook (2003) IMF. The first column is the photon energy in eV, and the second column is the comoving energy density in erg cm-3. Each file is for a different redshift, with the redshift (z) in the name of the file.

In a different format, the EBL intensities can be found as EBL_modelC_total_intensity.tar.gz. In this file, the first column is wavelength in angstroms, and the second column is the observed intensity in nW m-2 srad-1.

The γ-γ absorption optical depths for interactions between γ-rays and the EBL are in opacity_modelC.tar.gz. The first column is the observed γ-ray photon energy in TeV and the second is the absorption optical depth (τγγ). The absorption probability will be exp(-τγγ). Again, the redshift of the γ-ray source will be in the name of the file.
